## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=eval(input())
b=eval(input())
c=a.copy()
c.update(b)
print(c)
```
## Output
![439085591-4d645e84-54c4-44b7-9abe-a935cf5fbdf6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f985b44d-be94-447a-8500-3a08e8119631)

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
